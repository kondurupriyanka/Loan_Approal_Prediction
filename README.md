# 📊 Loan Approval Prediction

## 🔎 Overview
A machine learning project that predicts whether a **loan application will be approved or rejected** based on applicant financial and demographic details.  
The goal is to assist **banks and financial institutions** in making **faster, data-driven decisions**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details of applicants such as:

### 👤 Applicant Information
- Gender  
- Education  
- Marital Status  
- Employment Type  

### 💰 Financials
- Applicant Income  
- Co-applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Term  

### 📜 Credit History
- Past repayment records  

### 🏡 Property Area
- Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural  

### 🎯 Loan Status (Target Variable)
- Approved (Y) / Not Approved (N)


## ⚙️ Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical features  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized income levels  
- Analyzed loan distribution  
- Studied the impact of credit history  

### 3. Model Training
- Tested models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  

### 4. Evaluation
- Compared models using **accuracy** and **classification metrics**  
- Ensemble models gave the **best performance**


## ✅ Results
- **Credit history** emerged as the **strongest predictor** of loan approval  
- **Ensemble models** gave the **highest prediction accuracy**  
- Workflow helps **reduce manual screening time** and **improve decision fairness**


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
